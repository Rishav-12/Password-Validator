# Password-Validator
Java GUI app

### Motivation
* This was my first tryst with GUIs in Java.
* So it was a bit of a struggle but I enjoyed the experience.

### Description
* A simple password validator which validates passwords based on some simple rules
* Your password should be atleast 8 characters long and contain atleast one Uppercase letter, one Lowercase letter, one Number and one Special Character

### How to use
* Open cmd in the directory where the .java file is present
* Then run the following commands
  ```console
  javac validator.java
  java validator
  ```
* The GUI screen appears.
* Enter the password you want to check in the given field. Hit Check and it tells you if your password is strong enough based on the rules
